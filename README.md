Basic statistical information is calculated
for a distribution of values.

Measures of central tendency(the mean, median, mode)
are computed.

Also calculated, are measures of dispersion (the range, maximum
and minimum).

To give a much more clearer picture, the interquartile
range and a percentile are included.

The code is written in C++, and forms part of a
numerical programming series.
